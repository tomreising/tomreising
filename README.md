### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Tom Reising
I currently work as a Quantitative Developer with Principal Financial Group.  
I hold a master's degree in business analytics from the University of Iowa and a bachelor in accounting from the American Military University. I enjoy all things computer science related. Networking, big data, data science, distributed computing frameworks, graph algorithms ext.. all intrigue me. When I'm not spending time with the wife and kids I'm in the basement playing around with my home lab, always trying to learn new things. While I currently only have a few repos up, I'm working on moving more of my local projects up into my github account. So, hopefully as you return here you will see more content.  

Happy coding!!!
